        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>My journey in parenthood wasn't a traditional one. I was just 20, in the middle of college, when my future took a complete turn from the one I had planned. My pregnancy was not part of my original plan in life, but she became the most important part of my life.</p>
        <p>Even through struggles, I continued on one day at a time. I was a working mom, but also a mom who went to school at the same time. I studied during her naps, wrote papers with the baby monitor on my desk, and I will probably graduate with a degree in one hand and my little girl's hand in the other. I'm excited for life after graduation.</p>
        <p>I currently work as a delivery driver while I continue my education.</p>
        <p>I created this space because I know what it feels like to feel alone, to search for answers in the middle of the night, and to wonder if you're doing anything right.</p>
