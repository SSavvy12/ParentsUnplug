        <h2>Who We Are</h2>
        <p>Parents Unplugged is more than a website — it’s a safe space created for parents by parents. We’re here to help you unplug from perfection, share your truth, and connect with others who understand the highs and lows of raising little humans.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- Our Story -->
      <section class="about-section">
        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <div style="display:flex;gap:20px;align-items:flex-start;flex-wrap:wrap;">
          <div style="flex:1;min-width:260px;">
            <p>It all began with a single story — a young mom in college balancing late-night study sessions with early-morning feedings. At just 20, I became a mother and quickly learned that parenthood doesn’t come with a manual or a pause button. I juggled work, school, and motherhood, often wondering if I was doing enough.</p>
            <p>Through those long nights, I wished for a space to find encouragement — a place that said, “You’re not alone.” That’s why I built <strong>Parents Unplugged</strong> — a judgment-free zone for every parent, whether you’re thriving or just getting through the day.</p>
